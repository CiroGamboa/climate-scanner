The study found that if total global energy demand is reduced by 40 per cent by 2050, with a strong emphasis on electrification, renewable energy could more than meet the world's energy needs without having to rely on carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies for burning fossil fuels or plant matter. Dr Wilson said: \"Not only does our scenario show how to meet the 1.5\u00b0C climate target based on evidence of what is already possible, it also shows how this dramatic reversal in global emission trends supports a wide range of development objectives in the global South, from rising living standards to cleaner air and improved health."}
