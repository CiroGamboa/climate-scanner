Taking into account the fact that WWTPs with nitrogen removal carried out by nitrification-denitrification processes have a median emission factor of 0.01 kg N2O-N/kg [42], meaning that 0.6% of the inlet nitrogen is converted into N2O, the application of partial nitritation-Anammox processes in both sludge line (20% of the total nitrogen load with a conversion of 0.8% into N2O) and main stream (80% of the total nitrogen load with a conversion of 0.2% into N2O) will signify an important decrease of the N2O emissions."}
